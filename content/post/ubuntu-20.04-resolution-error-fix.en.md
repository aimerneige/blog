After upgrade my ubuntu 20.04, I find the system ui resolution is small and looks ugly. I search google for this which tell me to reinstall my Graphics Card Driver. But it doesn't work, so I have to try it myself. And here are my solutions:

1. Open the settings.
2. Select the Displays.
3. Change the scale bigger.
4. Select revert.
5. All done.

After the system reboot, this problem will appear again. But it really works.
