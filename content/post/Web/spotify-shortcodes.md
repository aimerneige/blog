Today, I accidentally found a good music from Spotify. I want to share it on my blog, so I try [this](https://gist.github.com/j-un/e7d0b3118556479392bd2269f7059242) awesome code. Bellow are the what it look like:

{{< spotify type="track" id="7tL9WRrT4ZJaDRgyLc7pIt" width="100%" height="250" >}}

Full code from [j-un](https://gist.github.com/j-un):

{{< gist j-un e7d0b3118556479392bd2269f7059242 >}}

Download this html file or copy the code, put it in `layouts/shortcodes/spotify.html`. Enjoy it!
