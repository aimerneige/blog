C# conventions
Conventions are best practices followed by programmers when writing source code. Each language can have its own set of conventions. Conventions are not strict rules; they are merely recommendations for writing good quality code. We mention a few conventions that are recognized by many C# programmers. (And often by other programmers too).

- Classes, Interfaces and Enums begin with an uppercase letter.
- Interface names start with an I letter.
- Comments are placed on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code.
- Method names begin with a uppercase letter.
- Only one statement or declaration is placed per line.
- Identifiers are easily readable and meaningful.
- Identifiers are written in PascalCase, e.g. each subsequent word begins with a capital letter.
- The public keyword precedes the static keyword when both are used.
- The parameter name of the Main method is called args.
- Constants are written in uppercase.
- Curly braces in code blocks start on a new line.
